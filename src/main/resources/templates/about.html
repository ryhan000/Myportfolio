							I&rsquo;m Osman Goni Nahid, Born and live in Bangladesh, Love to
							work with challenge, passion and new technology. I am a graduate
							of Software Engineering and currently working in the position of
							Lead Full Stack Engineer at a B2B and cloud platform service
							(PaaS) based company based in Singapore, named Ekkbaz. I put a
							lot of time in competitive programming (ACM ICPC) during my
							university life and participated 10+ National contest. In my 3+
							years of career, although my working area was mostly on Web
							technologies, Mobile application, IoT, Cloud data &amp; service
							Provider companies like Inovio, LocalInsights, Power GP Ltd &amp;
							ThirstyCrows where I played roles Full Stack Engineer, Software
							Engineer, Lead Engineer, I am more focused on fundamentals of
							computer programming, data structure, algorithm &amp; software
							engineering, which allows me to learn and getting used to with
							any kind of technologies quickly. I have several side projects
							and contribute some open source project too. The most notable one
							is an open source sentence based bangla programming platform <a
								href="http://potaka.io">potaka();</a> which is currently one and
							only programming learning platform for novices in Bangla
							available at potaka.io. An application I have also developed with
							my friends/team that help a farmer to identify disease of crops
							named AgroSkyLab which won the Champion in People Choice category
							at NASA Space Apps Challenge - 2016. My career goal is to work
							with distributed system, embedded software engineering and
							ultimately Internet of things.

						<h2 id="what-i-m-looking-for">What I&rsquo;m looking for?</h2>

						<p>I want to travel, I want to work and travel at the same
							time, working 100% remotely.</p>

						<p>I prefer to work with people that love the product we are
							creating, putting a lot of effort to improve what we are
							creating. People that really love coding.I believe I am capable
							to accept new challenges and meet my employer expectation who
							likes the Unix environment for development.</p>

						<p>I learn fast, early adopt and continuously explore with
							innovation.</p>

						<p>Flexible hours and flexible days will be a must. I want to
							manage my own schedule.</p>

						<p>As you can see, this is a &ldquo;perfect job&rdquo;.
							Meaning, you can offer something that do not full fill this
							points. We can negotiate it.</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>Note: I want to continue working in NodeJS &amp; Django. I
								prefer Backend, but frontend using ReactJS could be a good
								option and Mobile application with native or React-Native could
								be a fun. Also have some familiarity and interest with DevOps
								stuffs.</p>

									<li>Speaking &amp; Listening: When talking about technical
										stuffs, I have no problem, but, I feel like my vocabulary is

						<h2 id="a-bit-of-my-history">A bit of my history</h2>

						<p>
							From 2013 I started Software Engineering bachelor course at <a
								href="https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/">University</a>, During
							University life I put a lot of time in competitive programming
							(ACM ICPC) during my university life and participated 10+
							National programming contest. And started learning Android Mobile
							Application development besides study. Fortunately, I got a Job
							offer in middle of my University-life from a local company to
							join as Android Application Developer then started there&hellip;
						</p>

						<p>From 2014 to 2016 I always worked in personal (and job)
							projects using always the same technologies (creating and setting
							up absolutely everything on my own).</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Linux(Ubuntu)</li>
							<li>GIT</li>
							<li>Android (Java,XML)</li>
							<li>C/C++/Python (Problem Solving/Contest)</li>
							<li>SQLite, MySQL</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Then, I left my happy Mobile-Apps-Dev-life and I started
							working using another stack:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Ubuntu server (setting it up using Vagrant)</li>
							<li>GIT</li>
							<li>Apache</li>
							<li>Nginx</li>
							<li>PHP (Slim , Laravel &amp; Raw)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>This stack was super productive for me until mid 2016,
							moment where I got opportunity to work on NodeJS, ReactJS,
							Django, AWS and Firebase. So now, my stack for personal projects
							has this shape:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>NodeJS/Express (Backend)</li>
							<li>Python/Django (Backend)</li>
							<li>AWS</li>
							<li>Azure</li>
							<li>Microservice</li>
							<li>GIT</li>
							<li>Firebase Hosting for static serving</li>
							<li>Firebase Functions and Firebase Database for no-sql
								database and backend (creating some kind of REST API in Firebase
								Functions)</li>
							<li>React (+JSX) + Redux + Thunks + Reselect as frontend</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							^ This is my current Stack.
							<code>REST API</code>
							, frontend with
							<code>React</code>
							and
							<code>Backend</code>
							using
							<code>Django and/or Express + SQL + NoSQL &amp;
								Non-Relational-DB (like Postgres, Mongo)</code>
							. Full ECMAScript stack.
						</p>

						<h2 id="companies-where-i-worked">Companies where I worked?</h2>

								I&rsquo;m always working in personal projects to improve
								knowledge in different technologies.</li>
